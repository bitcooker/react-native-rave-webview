# Web View Wrapper for Rave by Flutterwave(https://rave.flutterwave.com/)
A web view wrapper for Flutterwave Rave payment gateway with support for React Native v0.60 and doesn't require any react native linking.

This package allows you plug-in Rave's payment gateway directly into your react native application and start accepting payment immediately.

This package copies a similar loading design to that of Rave, which makes transistion to Rave's website less noticeable. This package also offers a cancel button, so one can easily cancel if Rave takes a long time to load its content (the ``` onCancel ``` props event is called when this happens).

### Compatibility
|`@react-native-community/cli` |`react-native`|

    > npm install @creativejoe007/react-native-rave-webview --save

## Usage

    import {RaveWebView} from '@creativejoe007/react-native-rave-webview';

 #### 2. Set your success, failure and close methods

        super(props);

      }

      onSuccess(data) {
        console.log("success", data);
        // You get the complete response returned from FlutterWave,
        // just incase you need more than the reference number

      }

      onCancel() {
        console.log("error", 'Transaction was Cancelled!');
      }

      onError() {

#### 3. Use component (ensure to set currency for the desired payment method to display)

                txref="<your-autogenerated-transaction-reference>"
              />
